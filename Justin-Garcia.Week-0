#### 1. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?

One thing that really helped me in class this week was going over the challenges on the overhead after pairing up and attempting these challenges. It helped me to get a better understanding of how to really break down these problems. By doing so, this simplified a lot of things for me. Also, posting the codes on slack was really helpful to reference back to.
