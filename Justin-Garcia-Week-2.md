 let and const became available in ES6. let allows a variable to be changed in a global and local scope whereas const will remain the same and cannot be changed in a global or local scope.

 #### 9. What is the difference between a div and a span?


 //Your Answer
 I believe the difference between div and span is that div is used to divide elements whereas span is used to divide something in the same line as an element.

 //Googled Answer
The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

#### 10. How would you explain the idea of "inheritance" in object oriented programming?


 //Your Answer
Inheritance in object oriented programing is the idea of using objects and methods in a parent class and using them in a sub class that extends a parent class. Objects and methods can also be added to these sub classes.
 //Googled Answer
When you attempt to access a property or method of an object, JavaScript will first search on the object itself, and if it is not found, it will search the object's [[Prototype]] . ... At the end of the prototype chain is Object.prototype . All objects inherit the properties and methods of Object.
